Our paper on [ULLER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00532), a general-purpose NeSy language, is accepted as a **spotlight oral** presentation at [NeSy 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/nesy2024/home?authuser=0). We are also giving a round of tutorial on ULLER.

ULLER is a Python library we are developping with [Emile Van Krieken](https://www.emilevankrieken.com/), [Eleonora Giunchiglia](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/e.giunchiglia) and [Robin Manhaeve](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~robin.manhaeve/)  to simplify working with **Informed Nesy AI**. NeSy has been gaining attention recently but remains hard to approach/experiment with: there is a myriad of methods, each with their own knowledge representation, making it difficult to experiment and benchmark with NeSy. Our library aims to solve this. ðŸš€

ULLER provides:
* A shared language for expressing problem knowledge
* Integration with various Nesy methods
* Easy incorporation into ML workflows

[Our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00532) focuses on the design ofthe language and its semantics. We presented it at [NeSy 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/nesy2024/home?authuser=0) (spotlight) and also hosted a tutorial session and feedback discussions around a prototype version of the library.
