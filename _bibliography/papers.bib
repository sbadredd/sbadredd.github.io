  abstract = {The field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (NeSy), which
              combines learning and reasoning, has recently experienced
              significant growth. There now are a wide variety of NeSy frameworks
              , each with its own specific language for expressing background
              knowledge and how to relate it to neural networks. This
              heterogeneity hinders accessibility for newcomers and makes
              comparing different NeSy frameworks challenging. We propose a
              unified language for NeSy, which we call ULLER, a Unified Language
              for LEarning and Reasoning. ULLER encompasses a wide variety of
              settings, while ensuring that knowledge described in it can be used
              in existing NeSy systems. ULLER has a neuro-symbolic first-order
              syntax for which we provide example semantics including classical,
              fuzzy, and probabilistic logics. We believe ULLER is a first step
              towards making NeSy research more accessible and comparable, paving
              the way for libraries that streamline training and evaluation
              across a multitude of semantics, knowledge bases, and NeSy systems.

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence agents are required to learn from their surroundings and to reason about the knowledge that has been learned in order to make decisions. While state-of-the-art learning from data typically uses sub-symbolic distributed representations, reasoning is normally useful at a higher level of abstraction with the use of a first-order logic language for knowledge representation. As a result, attempts at combining symbolic AI and neural computation into neural-symbolic systems have been on the increase. In this paper, we present Logic Tensor Networks (LTN), a neurosymbolic formalism and computational model that supports learning and reasoning through the introduction of a many-valued, end-to-end differentiable first-order logic called Real Logic as a representation language for deep learning. We show that LTN provides a uniform language for the specification and the computation of several AI tasks such as data clustering, multi-label classification, relational learning, query answering, semi-supervised learning, regression and embedding learning. We implement and illustrate each of the above tasks with a number of simple explanatory examples using TensorFlow 2.},
