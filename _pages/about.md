I am a Research Scientist at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony/) in Barcelona, Spain, where I work with complex predictions in biomedical Knowledge Graphs. I am also pursuing my PhD in the [DKM Unit](https://dkm.fbk.eu/) at Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Trento, Italy. 

My research interests combine Neurosymbolic AI and Probabilistic ML, spanning from foundational aspects such as differentiability and optimization to practical and usable solutions. I developed the [Logic Tensor Networks](https://github.com/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks) library, a TensorFlow codebase for differentiable reasoning with fuzzy logics, which has found applications in various domains. 

Outside of work, I enjoy outdoor sports (rock climbing, diving) and game design.
